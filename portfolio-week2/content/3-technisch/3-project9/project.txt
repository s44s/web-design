This application is a real-time chat room. People are able to communicate with each other when they are on the same URL at the same time. Working with socket.io and create something that uses the realtime function. Refactored the jQuery chat example to vanilla JS so that I didn't need to use the jQuery library. Start with the basic chat then add a unique feature to understand the workings of socket.io.

As a user you can change the background color real-time. You can fill in a username and a message that will be send to all users at the same time. Besides that, when you type in a specific location, a map will show up with a marker on that specific point
