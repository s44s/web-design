# Portfolio website

In this repo I created a (portfolio) website to show the world who I am. It is not a portofolio site you are used to. By choosing a way of my skills, you will see some of my projects and skills.

## For who?
The visitors of my website will probably be 'my future clients'. They have heard about my website or find me on the internet and want to know more about me and my projects. They hope to find more information to make a decision if I will be the right person for their project. When they are impressed, they want to make an appointment to know more about me.

The user wants to achieve his goal(s). The goal to know enough to make a decision if I will match with the client, or not. When a client will be impressed by my work, their goal could be to get in touch with me. To make achieving this goal as easy as possible, I will help the user. By giving them a road through the website, they will get to know exactly what they need to make their decision.

### Special user
Marijn, a chief technical architect of a large tech company. He is severely motor impaired, it takes him quite some effort to have a little control over his muscles. He is also going to use my website, so I have to make it work for him.

The 18th of April I'm going to meet Marijn for the first time. I have came up with some question for him:
- You said that typing is really hard. How do you fill in a form normally? Do you use a microphone? What could I do if I want to use a form in my website?
- Do you prefer the focus state of the browser or a custom focus state?
- I really like to know, if you have to hire one new employee, what is for you most important?
- If you look around to portfolio websites, which are in your opinion 'good' and why?

## User scenario's
Marijn is looking for a new employee for his tech company. He received 43 portfolio websites and he only have one day to chose the right person. So he is looking straight for his goal.
* He wants to be impressed when he is visiting the site for the first time. When he will not be impressed he is not looking further.
* After that he wants to find out more about the code qualities of that person.
* If he finds it good enough, he wants to get in touch with that person.
* Besides this, Marijn is only using a keyboard because of his disability. He wants to use the site with the right functionality and pleasure.

## Sitemap
At the homepage you have four different option to explore my site. I'm explaining myself by three keywords An Inquisitive Creative Developer. You can either chose one of those three components, or you can chose them all in one.
